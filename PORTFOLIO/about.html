            <p><b>Builder of ideas. Strategist of clarity. Explorer of code.</b><br>
From the calm rhythm of late-night problem solving to the spark of a new project idea, I thrive on crafting experiences that are both intelligent and intentional. Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications, I bring together a strong foundation in engineering with a passion for:
<br>
 Simplifying complexity — turning tough concepts into clean, exam-ready formats <br>
 Creating practical web apps — using  Java, JavaScript, and SQL to build tools that work and teach <br>
 Designing smart study systems — flashcards, summaries, and cheat sheets that make revision feel like strategy <br>
I believe in the elegance of minimalism, the strength of structure, and the magic of genuine connection. Whether it's a technical deep dive or a creative side project, I aim to leave behind clarity, curiosity, and a touch of wonder. <br>
Thanks for visiting—explore my projects, peek into my process, and let’s build something meaningful together.
